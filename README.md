This Angular-based project was envisioned as an addition to the [Lor Decoder chatbot](https://github.com/As0biAsobase/LorDecoder).
It was to serve as an online resource for Russian community of the Legends of Runeterra (LoR) card game.
It offers a tool for searching/viewing card images, their descriptions and related cards, as well as some other functions at different stages of completion:

 - Banrooms (ability for two users to create a private room and perform deck bans/picks according to LoR rules)
 -  Exposed APIs for turning card codes into card names, retreiving leaderboards etc.
